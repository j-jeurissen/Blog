* Few Advices for conducting Python workshops to students:
  * Modify your slides according to duration of the talk and knowledge level of the audiance. Maintain version of each.
  * If target audiance is students, then bare in mind about target operating system they are using. 90% of them are using Windows.
  * Prepare proper version specific installation for Window, Mac and GNU/Linux
  * Focus on small, important things. Going into too much details will kill your time. You can always help intersted students after completing the workshops in your free time.
  * Clear purpose and things you will teach before starting workshop. It will help students to leave if they are already know the mentioned things.
  * Always take reviews from students. Taking review will help you to identify problems your audiance is facing.
  * Conducting small quiz/exercise at the end of the chepter helps you to motivate students and solve confusions they have.
  * I always put small conding exercise and instruct them to do in their laptop. (Students are not prepreared with IDE.)
  * Conducting talk with any small goodies helps to motivate them. Thanks for PSSI I distribute Python stickers while asking questinos and give stickers who gave correct answers.
