In conclusion I conducted 1 workshop per month. I enjoyed every moment of 2016.

I was jury at DAIICT hackthon IEEE.

Facilities I received while conducting workshops
------------------------------------------------

Places which were quit far from my town has provided travelling allowance to
me. Which I took because it I felt there is nothing wrong in taking that. Some
colleges arranged afternoon meal for me. I happy accepted that becuase finding
other option during short brack at unknown place is quit time consuming. There
were few colleges which gave cash cover as good will from their side. That I 
never decided to accept in my life. The reason I don't take money from any
educational institute is they sometimes devide that fee to number of students
attending workshop. I don't feel right to take money from the pocket of any 
students. Still some college claimed they are giving from their grants and
not taking anything from students. I took that money and donated each to
"arranged Krishna Vrudhashram"][krishna_vrudhashram]
