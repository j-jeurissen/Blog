title: Visit to Linux User Group Chennai

Recently I was travelling to [Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai)
for some personal work. I was very clear on meeting
[Mr.Shakthi Kannan](http://shakthimaan.com/). During my journy I dropped a mail
inquiring about his availability. He replied with an invitation to attend the
meetup of [Indian Linux Users Group
Chennai](https://www.meetup.com/ILUG-C/events/234086665/) scheduled at
[IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I happily accepted the invitation and
decided to attend the meetup.

The meetup was happening at the Aero Space Engineering department, IIT Madras
campus. I found the campus is quite huge in area. The cab driver dropped me at
the gate. It took 15 minutes bus journy to reach the department. Because I was late, I missed the initial talk on Emacs Org mode by Shakthi. I was lucky enough to
attend lightning talk section. When I entered into classroom one young boy was
demonstrating [BeFF](http://tools.kali.org/exploitation-tools/beef-xss). BeFF
is penetration testing tool. I was not aware about this tool before his talk.
After his words I am confident for switching to documentation and implimenting.
His talk ended with little discussion on doubts people were having. Nearly one
hour was still remaining. Shakthi came forward and invited interested people to
present if they want to. That ringed a bell on mine. I was even not sure about
attending meetup and presenting something instantly was looking little touch at
first glance. One guy moved forward and presented on Linux stacks(confirm this
topic with Shakthi). I quickly skimmed on list of topics I was aware about and
I decided to speak on [JSON Web
Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). Initially I started with
little description about myself. I demonstrated ways to generate token. Discussed
about architecture. Gave few guidlines and points to remember. I ended my talk
with comparing [Oauth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) with JWT. Few interested
people asked question and I was lucky enough to solve their confusions. We
discussed about Angular JS and its versions. Little more discussion on Jquery,
React JS compared with Angular JS.

I realised it is good to have small and interested audiance than having large 
and outfocused one. The group has nice experienced people in the GNU/Linux
domain. If Chennai is your town, I will encourage you to join this group and
get involved.
