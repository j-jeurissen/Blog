Hi, I am Full-stack developer by profession, Computer scientist by heart, Actor by gene. I am speaker, Vimmer and Organizer of [PyKutch](http://cs.kutchuni.edu.in/PyKutch-2016/). I am Pythonista. Innovative programming is one of my hobby. In my free time I try to digest top rated programming books recommended by [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). I prefer to communicate via email, irc over physical. I support Free Software over Open or Closed Sourced software.
