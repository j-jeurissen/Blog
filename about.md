Hi, I am Full-stack developer by profession, Computer scientist by heart and
Actor by gene. I speak at local events, meetup or any technical conferences.
I love to conduct lectures on any specific topic for college students. I am
organizer of PyKutch. You can consider innovative programming as one of my
hobby. In my free time I try to digest top rated programming books recommended
by goodreads.  I prefer to communicate via electronic mail, IRC over physical.
I support The Free Software Foundation and always insist the point of userâ€™s
Freedom. I am astonished by the contribution of the GNU community and openly
thank them for giving us such a useful things.
