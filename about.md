Hi, I am Full-stack developer by profession, Computer scientist by heart and Actor by gene. I am speak on local events, conferences. I love to conduct lectures on any specific topic to college students. I am organizer of [PyKutch](http://cs.kutchuni.edu.in/PyKutch-2016/). I accept the truth that innovative programming is one of my hobby. In my free time I try to digest top rated programming books recommended by [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). I prefer to communicate via email, irc over physical. I support The Free Software Foundation and always insist the point of user's Freedom. I am amazed by the contribution of the GNU community and openly thank them for giving us such a useful things.
